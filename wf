Databases

AEM uses its internal CRX database.
An external database (Azure or SQL) is also in play.
AEM Section

Forms are stored in the AEM Forms Database.
Users access these forms via the Forms Portal.
User Actions

Submitter: Opens a form, can save drafts, and submits it.
Approver: Receives a notification and decides to approve or reject.
Workflow Inside AEM

Submitter submits a form.
A notification goes to the Approver's AEM inbox.
Approver makes a decision:
If rejected, a notification goes back to the Submitter.
If approved, the data moves outside AEM to Rule PAPI.
Workflow Outside AEM

Data goes from Rule PAPI to Fulfillment.
Finally, it moves from Fulfillment to IQA.
