Apologies for the oversight. Here's the revised version including the problem statement:

**Problem Statement:**
Currently, our build process is manual, requiring someone to manually trigger the build after each merge on the UAT environment. This approach is time-consuming and prone to delays.

**Solution Overview:**
To address this issue, we propose automating the build process using GitHub webhooks, which will enable Jenkins to automatically start builds when code is merged into the DEV/UAT environments. It's important to note that this automation will not apply to the production environment, where manual control will be maintained for safety.

**Steps:**

1. Configure Jenkins jobs to use the GitHub hook trigger for GIT SCM polling.
2. Enter the details of the GitHub repository.
3. Manage user permissions and access.
4. Set up a webhook in GitHub to connect with Jenkins.
5. Perform tests to ensure the webhook is functioning correctly.

**Benefits:**

- **Increased Efficiency:** Automates the build process, significantly reducing the time and effort required for manual builds.
- **Consistent Integration:** Automatically triggers builds for every merge, ensuring consistent and reliable integration testing.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Provides developers with immediate feedback on their merges, facilitating the quick identification and resolution of issues.
- **Resource Optimization:** Reduces the need for manual intervention, allowing team members to focus on more strategic tasks.
