Update on My Furlough Schedule

Hi XXXX,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to provide a quick update regarding my upcoming furlough period. I've recently received information indicating that my furlough is allocated as 2 weeks in November and 2 weeks in December. However, after discussing with my project teammates, I've already planned my leave as follows:

13th to 17th November (1 week)
11th to 29th December (3 weeks)
On a related note, XXXX will be on leave from 20th to 29th November. The good news is that there won't be any impact on our project, as Hirok will be available during my absence from 13th to 19th November.

XXXX mentioned that updates to the furlough schedule can be made if the manager agrees and sends an email for confirmation. If necessary, we can also seek approval from XXXX.

Thanks for understanding.

Best regards,
XXXXX
