Hi Rahul,

Below are the details for my expenses, but I am encountering issues while claiming this settlement as it involves eligible amounts.

1. The air ticket was booked by the team, so I don't have any claims there.

2. Hotel Accommodation cost was: ₹17,780, but the eligible amount is ₹11,475. This results in a difference of ₹6,305.

3. I also don't see an option for food claims. The total food claim is: ₹1,882.66, detailed as follows:
   - Food 1: ₹378 - Evening snacks, 4th
   - Food 2: ₹233.66 - Dinner, 4th
   - Food 3: ₹118 - Lunch, 5th
   - Food 4: ₹423 - Dinner, 5th
   - Food 5: ₹730 - Lunch and Dinner, 6th
   - Food Total: ₹1,882.66

4. There is no option for cab expenses claims. I have a total of ₹4,160.06 for cab expenses, detailed as follows:
   - Cab 1: Bangalore Home to Airport - ₹799.96
   - Cab 2: Hyderabad Airport to Hotel - ₹979.98
   - Cab 3: Hotel to Office - ₹115.10
   - Cab 4: Office to Hotel - ₹110.26
   - Cab 5: Hyderabad Hotel to Airport - ₹829.99
   - Cab 6: Bangalore Airport to Home - ₹1,324.77
   - Cab Total: ₹4,160.06

I have all original bills with me, but I am unable to claim them. I need help.

Thank you.
