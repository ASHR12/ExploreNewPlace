AEM Adaptive Forms, part of Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) CMS, allows for rapid design and deployment of forms.
As per the current architecture:
Internal forms can be hosted on the HSBC network for staff.
Integration with Rule PAPI and IQA is feasible.
Comprehensive form validation is supported.
Features include support for attachments and scribble signatures, as demonstrated.
Development and deployment of customer-facing forms can be discussed and implemented with the Architect's guidance.
